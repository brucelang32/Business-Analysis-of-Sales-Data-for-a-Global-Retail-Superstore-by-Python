# Business Analysis of Sales Data for a Global Retail Superstore by Python

## Problem Statament

A global retail superstore needs to know their sales performance over four years (2011-2015). They are interested in knowing:

**Overall performance**：sales、sales volume, profit、average transaction value(ATV)、market layout.

**Products**: commodity composition, popular products, unpopular products.

**Customers**: customer segmentation, customer status、retention and churn Rates, repeat purchase rate(RPR).

As a business analyst, I need to make an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and raise pertinence suggestions to increase sales. 

The dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jr2ngb/superstore-data)

## Business Analysis
I created my business analysis report on Jupyter Notebook to make it more clear and neat. You can open **analysis.ipynb** and see the whole report.
